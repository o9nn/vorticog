## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm package manager
- MySQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/o9nn/vorticog.git
cd vorticog
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and API credentials
```

4. Set up database:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

5. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run check    # TypeScript type checking
npm run format   # Format code with Prettier
npm run test     # Run tests
npm run db:push  # Apply database migrations
```

### Database Schema

The system uses a comprehensive schema with 27+ tables:

**Core Tables**:
- `users`, `companies`, `business_units`, `cities`
- `resource_types`, `inventory`, `production_recipes`
- `market_listings`, `transactions`, `notifications`

**Agentic Simulation Tables**:
- `character_personas`, `character_traits`
- `agents`, `agent_traits`, `agent_histories`
- `relationships`, `relationship_events`
- `agent_groups`, `group_memberships`
- `communities`, `community_memberships`
- `agent_events`, `event_triggers`

**DreamCog Integration Tables**:
- `agent_big_five_personality`
- `agent_motivations`, `agent_memories`
- `worlds`, `locations`, `lore_entries`
- `world_events`, `scheduled_world_events`

See [docs/AGENTIC_SIMULATION.md](./docs/AGENTIC_SIMULATION.md) and [docs/DREAMCOG_INTEGRATION.md](./docs/DREAMCOG_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed documentation.

## API Overview

The API is built with tRPC for end-to-end type safety. Key routers include:

### Business Management
- `company.*` - Company operations
- `unit.*` - Business unit management
- `production.*` - Production and manufacturing
- `market.*` - Market trading
- `transaction.*` - Financial transactions

### Agentic Simulation
- `persona.*` - Character personas
- `trait.*` - Character traits
- `agent.*` - Agent operations
- `relationship.*` - Relationship management
- `group.*` - Group operations
- `community.*` - Community management
- `event.*` - Event processing

### DreamCog Integration
- `personality.*` - Big Five personality
- `motivation.*` - Goal tracking
- `memory.*` - Experience tracking
- `relationshipEvent.*` - Relationship history
- `world.*` - World building
- `location.*` - Location hierarchy
- `lore.*` - Lore management
- `worldEvent.*` - Timeline events
- `scheduledWorldEvent.*` - Scheduled events

## Key Concepts

### Semi-Autonomous Agents
Agents make decisions based on:
- Personality traits and behavioral tendencies
- Current emotional state and psychological needs
- Memories and past experiences
- Relationships with other agents
- Motivations and goals
- Group and community influences

### Event-Driven Simulation
- Events shape narrative and game state
- Emotional impacts affect agent behavior
- Relationship impacts change social dynamics
- Historical tracking enables rich narratives
- Scheduled events create anticipation

### Dynamic Relationships
- Relationships evolve through interactions
- Significant moments are recorded as events
- Trust, affection, and respect change over time
- Social networks influence agent behavior
- Group dynamics affect individual choices
